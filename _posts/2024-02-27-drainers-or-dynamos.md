subtitle: Building healthier relationships for a happier you.

> Building healthier relationships for a happier you.

Ever feel drained by certain people in your life?

Just as unhealthy food can cripple your physical health, unhealthy relationships can drag down your happiness and quality of life.

A Harvard study spanning more than 80 years has shown that quality relationships are the #1 factor in life's happiness, outweighing social class, IQ, genetics, and other factors we commonly think of.

Unfortunately, many people struggle with this for several reasons:

- **Lack of Awareness**
  "Yeah, I know my boss was gaslighting me, but who's not?" It's not uncommon to think that everyone lives a life like us, that our status quo is also others' everyday life. Though it's a useful psychological defense mechanism to protect us, it may also blind us from other possibilities.
- **Loop of Negativity**
  "I want changes, but I'm tired..." An unhealthy relationship will drain our energy, making the changes harder to make. Breaking the cycle is the key to a healthier relationship.
- **Fear of Losing**
  "He/She's all I have..." Oftentimes, people who are deeply involved in unhealthy relationships are also suffering from limited meaningful connections. The fewer connections we have, the harder letting go of the unhealthy ones.

  In this letter, I want to introduce two methods for **measuring** and **managing** the relationships in your life.

  Let's dive in.

### **Identifying Your Feelings**

The first step is to become aware of your own feelings. Take a moment to reflect on recent interactions. List both positive and negative experiences, like:

**Positive:**

- Laughter-filled conversations with a close friend
- A supportive work environment
- A meaningful conversation with a family member

  **Negative:**

- Draining interactions with someone who criticizes you
- Feeling unheard during a conversation
- Experiencing negativity from a coworker
  The key here is to focus on the **moments** , not the relationships themselves.

  It's very likely to have a good experience with a person in one situation but feel uncomfortable with the same person in another one.

  Human beings are just as complicated as that.

  So instead of judging a relationship as good or bad, popularizing the good moments and reducing the bad ones.

  But how?

### Editing The Moments

At a minimum, there are two dials we can adjust to these experiences — **frequency** and **duration**.
**Frequency** means how often that experience happens.
If you had a great conversation with a friend or had a fun experience playing certain sports, why don't you make them happen more regularly? You can propose a weekly coffee chat with the person or a bi-weekly game on the weekend.

For any undesirable experience, avoid them as much as you want. Remember, we can always say No. You don't have to come up with a reason to explain why you don't want to do things. "No" is a complete sentence.

But there are situations that are difficult to avoid — such as working with an annoying boss.

So we can try the other dial.
**Duration** means how long things affect you.
The direct impact of happening is not always under our control. If you have an argument with someone, that burning feeling inside you won't be easy. There is no magical spell to eliminate it immediately.

Once it happens, all we can do now is to control the damage to its minimum.

Take a few deep breaths, go out for a walk, talk with a friend, or whatever works for you.

It's okay to feel sad, angry, disappointed, and all the negative feelings. But it's also our responsibility to deal with them.

The sooner we can control that spreading feeling the better we can manage the impact of the undesirable happenings.

Be a firefighter.

Once you can master this skill of putting off a burning feeling, you will be surprised at how much control you take back from life.

### Take Your Time

Remember, this is an ongoing process. Don't get discouraged if your initial efforts don't yield immediate results. Keep adjusting your approach and celebrate your progress.

Until next time,
