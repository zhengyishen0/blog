> 3 ideas worth sharing this week.

Hello, my dear friends,
First things first, I’ve recovered from last week’s meltdown. Thank you for your asking and caring. 
During a week of being incapable of doing anything, I learned something about myself — that success and wealth have never been and will never be a major part of my life. 
I know that’s weird as they are crucial for most people, but somehow they are less significant in my life. The pains I suffered and the pleasure I enjoyed have never had anything to do with money. Money to me is just like water; it flows to me, and it flows by me.
But causes a huge problem. If success is not something I should chase after, what would that be? What should I spend the rest of my life on? And what is the joy of my life? 
I’m still searching for the answer. But if you have found what will make you happy, joyful, and fulfilled, keep it up.
Now, here are three ideas for this week.
**Start the business inside-out.**
In the end, business is an accumulation of people who love you and your products.
Here are different levels of liking from high to low. 
Your biggest fans are willing to work on your idea without any rewards, your best customers are the ones who are willing to pay a premium and spread the word for you, and the least you want to serve are the ones who will use the service only if it’s free.
Start with the inner circle of high-quality supporters and the journey will be more joyful.
**The magic of an auxiliary line.**
Do you remember those brain-teasing triangle problems in your middle school geometry class?
Many times you couldn’t figure out the solution even if you pulled out all your hair, but with one magical auxiliary line, the problem suddenly became easy enough for a five-year-old. 
That happens to life as well. Sometimes you just an auxiliary line to solve those unsolvable problems. 
But the hardest things are two: first, you need to realize there's an auxiliary line you can add. Second, you have the intelligence to figure where to add this line.
The basis of the auxiliary line is a shift in perspective. To do that, you need to acquire multiple perspectives first. 
In this era, coding is one of those skills that can bring you a different angle. And English is another one. The more perspectives you master, the easier you will see those magical auxiliary lines.
**The outflow of love**.
Life is like a shampain tower. You should always fill the top cup first, and then the outflow will fill in the rest and lower cups.
That flow pouring down is love. That first cup is “the self” of you, and the rest cups are your family, career, and any other things you care about.
Love yourself first and then let the outflow of it nurture the rest parts of your life. Don’t do it the other way.

Cheers,
