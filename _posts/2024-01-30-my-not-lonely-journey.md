> No one can overcome loneliness alone.

This is the story of my three-year-long battle with depression and loneliness that ultimately set me free. And it all happened because of a despairing breakup…

November 2, 2020, 9:18 pm.

I had been staring at a medicine bottle for an hour. Three minutes later I was going to make a life changing decision. But at that moment, I was still wondering in my thoughts -

"It has been five years, five years... Am I going to take it forever..."

It had been five years since I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder. Taking pills twice a day didn't help with the suffering from the depression and the sudden attacks of my emotional outbursts. If you’re not familiar with depression, it's a world of grey where all the pleasure brings you no joy. There's not too much pain, to be honest, but only the endless void eating your soul.

It's a status of being alive but dead.

"I'm sick of taking this stupid pill and counting on others, expects, to fix my problem. I'd take full responsibility for my life, even if I had to go down this path alone." I talked to myself.
The mind was made - and the medicine bottles were in the trash.

December 23, 2021, night in Las Vegas.

I got a call when I was walking on the Strip bumping shoulders with the crowd.

It had been a year since I threw away my pills. I tried many things to get myself back to normal -

- Taking a 3-month life coaching training with the goal of saving myself and helping others;
- Shutting myself into complete silence on a 10-day Vipassana retreat;
- Attending a group counseling with eight strangers and opening up my wounds again and again.

The bad news was, none of them really worked. The feeling of voidness would always come back no matter what I did. The good news was - my condition didn't get worse after stopping the pills. (It's interesting to reflect that how a pill that makes you numb can help you treat the illness that makes you numb).

I made a big move this year - joining the MBA program at Babson College. As a born entrepreneur, I was thrilled to enrolled in the #1 ranked entrepreneurship school in the world. The problem is - I had never gone abroad and I couldn't speak English at that time (I got my TOFEL and GMAT scores waived thanks to Covid).

So the moment I landed at Boston Logan Airport in August, my life switched to survival mode.

If you have never experienced it, let me tell you - living in a foreign country where you can't speak the language will make you look like a total idiot.

I ordered a nice IKEA bed for the new apartment. But because I couldn't figure out where to buy tools at first, I left the bed unassembled for a week. Then what was to be a week of floor-sleeping turned into a year-long habit. (Oh god. The mattresses here were too soft!)

College life was even harder. It shocked me that I couldn't even understand a word from the professor in my first class. Let me repeat, not a single word!

Luckily, I still had my girlfriend. In case I didn't tell you, she was the reason I came to this country - to study with her and get married after our graduations.

Oh, that call on the Strip in Vegas, it was calling from her.

And it was a break-up call - one day before Christmas Eve.

-

So I ended up traveling alone on the trip that I had planned for two and developed a routine of a 2-hour morning cry to kick off the day.

January 6, 2022, 4:30 pm.

Two days after I came back from the West Coast, the darkness got me. No words could describe the soul-eating feeling at that moment. I'd say it was a more painful feeling than death - and I'd already done it if the image of my parents crying didn't flash.

Outside that darkness was complete isolation.

My family and friends in China were still sleeping, they wouldn't be able to get on the phone even if I called. My friends in the US had supported me in the past two months and I didn't want to put any burden on them anymore. No friends in Boston I could call due to my limited English. The only person I trusted and could reach out to was my ex. But as you know, that was not an option either.

So there I was, at the moment with tremendous pain and had no one I could talk with on a planet full of people.

That was the moment I asked myself “Is this what I want to end with - no love, no friends, no meaning, nothing?”

I heard a voice roaring in silence.

"Noooo!"

-

There my transformation started.

I challenged myself to all the "impossible". Because it's no longer an option to me - it's a matter of life or death.

Yes, I was introverted, shy, and awkward, but I had to get out and reach out.

Yes, I was nervous, stuttering, and unconfident, but I had to stand up and speak up.

Yes, it felt scary, terrifying, and unbelievable, but I had to do all the crazy things I'd never done in the past 30 years.

Through countless moments of awkwardness, disappointment, and burnout, I gradually learned to:

- Love myself - thanks to this poem I read every morning,
- See the value in me, which had become the topic of my commencement speech,
- Speak up - realizing I deserve the time and my voice worth being heard.

I had also unlocked the experience never had:

- The joy of talking with people (Yes, I've never enjoyed talking with people before)
- The pleasure of meeting new friends (which only made me feel anxious before)
- The warmth of being trusted and cared for (it saved me from all the disappointment)

-

To many's surprise (to be honest, I'd be the one surprised the most) I've become someone who can

- Make new friends on a weekly basis without hustling - after I discovered the mechanism of the "friend-making chain reaction".
- Talk to people I met for the first time and earn their trust - once I understood the principle of "value exchange" in interpersonal activities.
- Get connected with like-minded people - by "sending signals" to the universe.
- Settle conflicts, stand up for friends, and defend my own interests - thanks to the "dynamic boundaries of 2/3".
- Repair relationship after arguments and disagreements - a narrative shift that turn "you and me" into the story of "we".

-

Don't get me wrong. I still have many challenges and questions in my life haven't figured out. But the journey I've been through told me that even the most impossible today is possible one day and could even become effortless someday.

So I'm here to share the lessons I learned, the methods I developed, and my wins and fails to all the lonely people out there. With my best hope, may you feel loved, valued, and connected with yourself and people you care for. May you also be the beacon that light up the way for others.

Because -

No one can overcome loneliness alone.
