Everyone wants a great life.
But how do some people make it so hard and even miserable for themselves?
What’s going wrong?
And how to fix it if possible?
If you’re feeling stuck in life and find no way out, let’s dive in.

## **The Driving Force of Life**

First of all, we need to understand what are the factors that differentiate people and how much we can control them.
What’s in your mind?

- **Talent?** Mozta can compose music at the age of 5. Of course talent matters.
- **Family?** Some people are born in wealth, some people are born in power, and some people are born in poverty. The family you grow up with makes a huge difference.
- **Time?** The life in the age of war is totally different from the one in the age of peace. Check.
- **Hard work**? I believe no one will deny the necessity of hard work to success and a good life in general. Check.
- **Luck?** Oh, this is a tricky one. In the startup world, timing is a well-known factor of success. Steve Jobs is not the first person to put a computer into a phone, but he arrived at the right time when all the required technology was ready for a seamless experience. So I will check this one as well.
  Talent, family, time, hard work, luck…
  What did you find?
  The first three drivers — talent, family, and time — are determined at the moment we are born and are completely out of our control (some people might be adopted by another family, but it’s still out of their control). Basically, we can put these three into the name of **fate** , if you agree.
  Luck, by its definition, is a factor that is out of people’s control.
  The only thing left on the table that we can determine is hard work.
  “So we’re saying hard work is the only way to a better life?”
  No, not at all!
  In fact, the belief that hard work can change life is the #1 trap that causes people to get stuck in their lives, burn out themselves, and fall into depression.
  Yes, hard work is a belief. It’s unfalsifiable.
  You can find millions of pieces of evidence that hard work changes people’s lives, but you can also find another million pieces of evidence that it doesn’t work the way it promised. The issue is that only the successful people’s voices get heard.
  What’s even worse is that once you associate success only with hard work, you risk putting yourself either into the downward spiral of self-denial or the dead end of burnout.
  And if you’re really obsessed with working hard on a specific task, you will probably become less lucky. (Wonder why? We will have a future article discussing how to increase luck.)
  “But working hard is the only thing I can do, don’t I?”
  Yes, and No.
  The hard truth is that even hard work is something beyond your control. Research shows that the tendency to be hardworking is genetic (here’s the [paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7560/730038)), which means whether you can work hard or not is part of your fate.
  “So you’re going to let me believe that my life is just about fate and luck? Stop it! You’re making me depressed!”
  Sorry to make you feel that way. But the night before dawn is the darkest, and we’re at the edge of the daybreak.
  In the next letter, we will discuss an effortless way to achieve your best. As the ancient Chinese wisdom said:
  **“Do nothing and achieve everything.” —Tao Te Ching, Lao Tzu**
  Until next time,
  _**Zhengyi**_
