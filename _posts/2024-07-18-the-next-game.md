> 3 ideas worth sharing this week.

Hello, my friend,
When do you feel your life stagnated last time? For me, that is — right now. 
The success of my tennis coaching business makes me too happy to change in my comfort zone, and the death in the womb of my e-commerce project killed the second growth curve.
But I need a change. Not because of financial considerations, but in search of a rich life experience. 
Business, to me, is never about making money, but channels to connect with the world. I need my work to talk with the world. It’s driven by my endless fear of loneliness and isolation.
Life is a game to me. It has been a boring and even depressing game for more than three decades, but it started to turn into something a bit more fun recently. 
I’m constantly trying to discover different ways of playing in this open-world game. Before I find my next game, I’m wondering, what game are you playing in your life?
**Learn to teach.**
Teaching is everywhere in business operations.
Marketing is teaching — you need to teach your customers that they have a problem they need to fix right away and you have a solution to it.
Sales are teaching — you need to teach your potential buyers that you are their best option and most importantly, the offer is worth the price.
Leadership is teaching — you need to convince your team that they can achieve a better performance by following your guide, and here is how to achieve this goal in 1-2-3 steps.
Negotiation is teaching — you need to teach your counterparty that the proposal you raise is a win-win for both parties and that they shouldn't pressure you for more.
To be a good teacher, you need to:
1. Understand the context and fundamentals of this topic (which means you know “what to teach”).
2. You can generate 10+ ways of explaining the same idea (which means you have the full arsenal of “how to teach”).
3. You can find that ONE method that your student clicks (which means you figure out the “why to teach” for this specific case).
That’s why teaching to me is like playing puzzles. 
Once you can find the right piece that connects all the dots, the rest of the mess will immediately make sense to you. 
**Enjoy loneliness.**
For those who have followed this newsletter, you know I’m always in search of the answer to loneliness. But the epiphany I had recently showed me that the answer might be the opposite, that:
**Loneliness is the essence of a human life.**
The fact that we all have individual inner worlds in our brains — and we interpret this world in the stories of me, we, and others — makes it crystal clear that we are fundamentally unable to understand each other.
We appreciate the activities of feeling united into one — watching a football game, listening to a cheering speech, and having sex. But they are only flashes of moments in the long journey of life. 
The liberation from loneliness (and any form of pain in life) starts from the acceptance, that loneliness is just a feeling like hunger and thirst that we need to deal with in everyday life. 
And then can we see the beauty of it, that loneliness is just the other side of freedom. 
The pursuit of freedom is indeed the pursuit of loneliness.
**Prioritize respect.**
Most people I know are looking for love, attraction, or other substantial criteria (like wealth, status, appearance). 
I was the same before and failed as many times as I tried.
But when I reflected on all my failures and asked if I could find one indicator that could tell the bad ending at the beginning, the answer was clear and unanimous —
The failure of any relationships in my life, from romantics to partnerships, always fell apart starting from respect, and you can tell that right from the start.
That person might adore you, desire you, or look up to you, but they don’t necessarily respect you. And if you don’t see that respect from the beginning, it’s less likely you will see it later. It’s not something you can cultivate.
In the end, respect shouldn’t be given only to people who are above us. Respect is a universal attitude we should give to anyone, from the homeless to the billionaires, and it should be indifferent.
And the ability to give respect is a quality a person is born with and cultivated in their childhood. It’s not what can be educated or changed in the later stage of their life. I know it’s sad, but it’s the truth.
My only advice to you is — keep a distance from those don’t show respect to the poor and under. Because they would do the same to you when things don’t go well.

That’s all for this week.
Best,
_**Zhengyi**_
