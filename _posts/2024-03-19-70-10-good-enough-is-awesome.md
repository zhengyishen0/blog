> The best way to do less and achieve more (math proved).

You must have heard about the 80/20 rule — 80% of the work is done by 20% of the effort. I’m going to introduce you to a new concept. I call it — **the principle of 70/10**.

- 100 is perfect.
- 90 is excellent.
- 80 is great.
- 70 is good enough.

When we were students, we were all taught to strive for the best. Although a full score is awesome, spending 100% effort to achieve a 100% result is actually not a good idea.

Why? Simple math:
- If you follow the principle of perfection, all you get is 100%.
- If you follow the 80/20 rule, the maximum you'll get is 400% (80% x 5).
- If you follow the principle of 70/10, the maximum you'll get is 700% (70% x 10)!

See how being good enough is 7x better than being perfect.

When you are seeking a perfect life, you are likely to make yourself mediocre.

When you can let go and settle down with a good enough life, suddenly your life becomes awesome!

Life is counterintuitive.

**Good Enough is Awesome!**

But it's not always about subtraction, **sometimes the most cost-efficient way requires a bit extra effort.**

Let me tell you a story.

When I was in business school, I had lots of readings and case studies. As a slow reader, it usually took me 3 hours to prepare for each case.

I had two classes every day, which required 6 hours of reading — after a whole day of classes starting from 8 am and intense group projects in the afternoon.

So a daily routine for me was getting up at 7 am and finishing my reading around 1 am.

As you can imagine, I burned out quickly.

Some of my friends suggested me to ignore the reading completely as the professor wouldn't examine each student.

Then I did a quick math:
But if I didn't read the case, I could not catch up in the class so I would have a miserable 5 hours. And since I got nothing from the class, I would feel horrible for myself. That would require 2 hours of video watching to comfort my stress level. The after-class assignments would also take me more time to finish, 1 extra hour at least.

If I didn't invest 6 hours in reading at night, I would waste 8 hours the next day.

Not a good idea!

So I decided to continue my reading routine, with a little modification:

Instead of fully digesting the HBS articles and case studies, I only aimed at the level of understanding that can help me catch up with what's going on in the class.

The new method took me only 30 minutes for each case, that is 1 hour every day, and helped me graduate Summa Cum Laude (the highest academic award). — Another example of the principle of 70/10!

**Wrap Up:**

- 100% / 100% = 100% — Perfection can lead to mediocrity.
- 70% / 10% = 700% — Good enough is awesome!
- 0% / 0% = ??? — Inaction is risky.

Until next time,
