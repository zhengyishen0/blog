> A reflection on my journey of building business and making money.

* * *
After running my little business for a few months, I started to think of the “perfect” business I wanted to build. 
Here’s a list of characteristics of my ideal business:
1. It can generate enough money to support a middle-class lifestyle.
2. It doesn’t require me to stay in one place all the time.
3. It requires 4 hours or less of my time a day on average.
That sounds like a dream, isn’t it? 
But I’ll argue that we're not as far from this dream life as we thought.
Just to give you a sense, my little tennis coaching business takes me 2 hours a day and generates 5k/mo. So, in theory, I would get $120,000 a year if I worked 4 hours a day throughout the year. 
So this tiny little business had already met the requirement of “4-hour work” and 50% of the “middle-class lifestyle” (you need $200,000 for a household to have a middle-class lifestyle in Boston). 
But the tennis coaching business has its limitations: 
1. It’s not scalable: I have to be the one to teach and I only have that amount of hours a week.
2. It’s seasonal: winter is a disaster for tennis. That’s why many will teach skiing or snowboarding during the snow season.
3. It has a price ceiling: I’ve already charged a premium price for my lesson, which requires me to have a great sales pitch to land a new student. However, that amount is not high enough compared with other forms of services, such as consulting and coaching.
So, I tried another business — a Shopify store. 
The thought process was simple: Since the biggest limitation of the tennis coaching business is my time, it would be great if I could let the product do the service for me. Using products as leverage is a common business practice (e.g. SaaS).
But I was wrong.
Yes, products have leverages. But I’m not the one to capture that part of the profit. Since I don’t produce the product, I have to purchase the product at the market price. And because I don’t have any followers on social media, I need to spend tons of money on ads to capture my customers. Not to mention the insane amount of cost in logistics that killed my Shopify store in the womb. 
So in the end, I was only able to capture the price difference between a fair price in the retail market minus the cost of the wholesale price and expenditures on ads — what was left was the value of my legwork moving things around (at the optimistic assumption that we could make a sale).
The bottom line is that I’m still getting paid for the work I did. And it’s even riskier than just providing the service.
But thanks to that failure, I found the three components that generate real money:
1. Work
2. Capital
3. Risks
They are the only three reasons people can make money. Let me explain.
**Work:** This is easy. We get paid for the jobs we do. However, the wealth conversion efficiency of pure work is very limited. You can argue that consultants at McKinsey and software engineers at Google get paid well. But that’s not really because of the hard work they do (hours of work) but the leverage of their capital. This brings us to the next component.
**Capital:** Capital is not just about money. We have intellectual capital, social capital, human capital, and financial capital. There’s a flow of conversion between these four types of capitals which we will discuss in another letter. In the case of a McKinsey consultant, they have leverage from their intellectual capital (knowledge and intelligence) and social capital (college degrees from top education institutes and alumni networks all over the industries). 
**Risks:** This world rewards risk-takers. In fact, taking risks is the biggest reason entrepreneurs and investors build their wealth. In the case of an e-commerce store owner, the reason they can make money is not just because they work hard and put in capital — but more about the risks they bear. 
So we can get a simplified equation of wealth.
**Wealth = Work x Capital x Risks x Time**
Now if we go back to the case of my tennis coaching business, it’s clear why it’s making little money.
1. The capital I’m using is limited. I’m only using the experience I have with tennis as an amateur in the last decade (intellectual capital) and my reputation among students which I just built up (social capital).
2. I’m not taking much risks. Coaching is a quite safe business, thus little reward from that component.
3. I don’t want to work too much. Very much of my personal choice but also a reasonable one in terms of creating a second growth curve.
So how can we create a faster way of building wealth?
The first strategy is to leverage more high-value capital. For example, I can give technical consulting based on my experience in data science, software development, and AI. I’ve given a few sessions of consulting and all my clients are happy to pay an hourly rate much higher than what I can get from teaching tennis. 
The second strategy is to take more risks. The most common risk-taking business is investment — which is what I’m doing right now. I’ll share my portfolio and the thought process for setting such a portfolio in the next letter.
Both of these approaches take time to build up the momentum. And time is by far the most important component in this equation. 
Let’s be patient.
