> Understanding yourself through duality.

_How many selves do you have within you?_

If we want to love ourselves, this is the first question we need to figure out.

Take a moment to come up with your own answers - not just a number, but also the specific selves you found. What are they, when will they appear, and how do they behave? I’ll share the selves I found at the very end of this letter.

Many selves you may have. I’d like to start with **two**.

You have at least two selves within you. You’ll see later in the letter that this perspective will help you better understand most of the personal struggles you’re having right now.

So what are these two selves?

People have tagged many names on them: the intellect and the emotion, the teller and the doer1, the elephant and the rider2, system one and system two3, the left brain and the right brain, and many others.

All these different names reflect the polarized and (seemingly) contradictory forces within us. Understanding these two forces is the very first step to self-understanding and self-love.

In this letter, we're going to call these two forces: **the ego and the self**.

The ego is the talking one, the voice that constantly whispers in your head. It’s the one who is always thinking, judging, and criticizing. It’s the intellect, the teller, the rider, and your left brain. It’s the one you think you are.

The self is the quieter one, the mood in the background, and the vibe everywhere. It’s the one who can only feel and execute but cannot utter a word. It’s the emotion, the doer, the elephant, and your right brain. It’s the one who suffers.

The word “ego” has gained some negative impressions these days. But it doesn’t mean to be. And remember, if you want to love yourself, you also need to love your ego.

The definition of ego, if you flip the dictionary, is self-esteem and self-importance. For human survival, the ego serves as an important function of experience interpretation. It constantly strives to make sense of the world, find meanings, and create narratives to make itself feel safe and good. It is a defense against the endless feeling of helplessness after the detachment from the mother as a union. The ego, or the storyteller if you want to call it, is also a bridge that leads to a conscious reunion with everyone and everything through collective narratives4. The prosperity of modern society — commerce and markets, nations and governments, culture and media - has all been driven by the relentless pursuit of the ego.

So what about “self”?

The answer to this question is way more complicated than this letter can cover. To make it very simple here, the self is the source of life. The self is the reason we can have all the senses of feelings. It is the ignition and motivation behind our actions. It is the physical, psychological, and even spiritual foundations of our beings.

If it’s still hard to understand, let me try to use an analogy and see if it helps.

See, we all use smartphones these days, and you may be using them to read this letter right now. Our ego is the touch screen, where you can see the content and use your fingers to navigate and click through. You may even feel you have a direct connection with what is on the screen, as modern technology has made this experience seamless and intuitive. But the reason you can use your fingers to scroll this page is far more complicated than this single motion. There’s tremendous complexity enclosed in the device you’re using that can make it work like magic. **In a smartphone, it’s called the Operating System. In human beings, it’s called the Self.**

This is the first letter in our self-love series and it has been long enough. If you make it here, congratulations! Because you’re going to learn what has never been taught in the education system but is essential to the happiness and well-being of every single human — how to love oneself and others.

As promised, I’m going to share the number of selves I’ve witnessed in me. And the answer is — countless. I found there’s a unique self that exists in every relationship I have, not only with people but with everything. If you’re interested in the reason, stay tuned.

So long!
