> 3 ideas worth sharing this week.

Hello my friend,
Sorry for missing out last week. I had got quite sick for a few days, but don't worry, I’ve fully recovered now.
This week, I’d like to share three ideas I learned from readings and conversations with friends. Hope you would also like them.
**You make more (money) because who THEY are,**
**NOT because of who YOU are.**
— Alex Hormozi
Making money by providing better knowledge is common knowledge.
But the unconventional wisdom is that you can make more money with the same service, as long as you can target/attract more valuable customers.
In the end, a business is a “customer factory”. (More on this concept next time)
**Follow your talent, not your passion.**
— Scott Galloway
If you put hard work into your talent, you would be really good at it. And if you are really good at something, very likely you would enjoy it.
**Don’t worry about losing friends, as long as you are moving forward.**
— Keke Xie
The quality of our friends matches the value of us as a person. As long as we are growing, exploring, and fighting, real friends won’t leave, and we will also meet better friends ahead.

That’s all for this week. See you next time.
