> The patterns of fate.

Last time, we ended at a desperate conclusion: “**[Life is all about fate and luck](https://zhengyishen.substack.com/p/driving-full-speed-life)”.**
As promised, this letter is about how to “**do nothing and achieve everything** ”.
To do that, we’re going to distill the mechanism of fate. 
If you want to manage your life, you’d better understand how fate functions. (We’ll cover luck in another letter)
## What Is Fate?
Life is like driving.
Everything we see through the windshield is the happenings in life. 
Everything we see from the back mirror is the memories fading away.
When you drive on a mountain road without the GPS signals, you don’t know what’s coming up to you next and you easily forget where you have driven from. 
That is what life looks like in many of us’s eyes — it’s full of twists and turns, ups and downs, and uncertainties. We don’t know what’s up there, where this road is leading us, and how we can get to where we want to be.
But is it so?
If you fortunately have a drone with you, launch it in the air and you will see — the path you came from and the path that you're heading to. 
The mysterious path of life has become clear. 
The higher you can fly the drone, the better bird's eye view you have about life. And that is how you can know your life and fate — by getting your view into a higher dimension.
But that’s not an easy thing to do, is it?
Many people have tried to do future telling, astrology, Tarot, or BaZi. 
Some people even can use your blood type or zodiac signs to explain your fate.
I’m not here to discuss whether you should believe them or tag them as pseudoscience and dump them in the garbage bin.
I’m here to offer another way of looking at the path of life.
## **The Forces of Fate**
Let’s go back to the analogy of mountain road driving.
If you drive, you will see the patterns already — the twists and turns, ups and downs don’t matter so much. All you need to do is to follow the road. And even if you change lanes on those parts of roads, you won’t end up anywhere different.
But in a few situations, your lane-changing (aka your decisions) will make a huge difference — that is at the forks and intersections. With little effort, your life goes on to a different path, sometimes good, sometimes not so desirable. (I bet you have such experience on the highway, don’t you.)
These are the two fundamental mechanisms of fate — **convergence** (most of the time) and **divergence** (at the forks). 
(These patterns are called reinforcement feedback loop and balancing feedback loop in dynamic system theory).
The maneuver of the car is your effort. But your effort doesn’t matter much unless you apply it at the diverging moment of your life — at the forks.
That’s why you’ll find sometimes it’s so hard to make changes, but sometimes changes happen effortlessly and even without your notice. 
You may have experienced it already. Maybe it’s getting up early, maybe it’s losing weight, maybe it’s learning a new skill.
Say you made a plan to get up at 6 am and hit a run. But somehow the bed was too comfortable and the body was so heavy that you just couldn’t get yourself out of the bed. 
You tried different methods and forced yourself to be disciplined, but it just didn’t work. You got discouraged. But when you suddenly learn that the girl/guy you’re interested in is running every morning passing your place. Getting up early and joining the run becomes effortless.
That person is the “fork”.
The issue with forks is — you don’t have a word to say when and how they would come into your life.
The only thing you can do is to read the sign 
Before we dig deeper into “fate reading”, there’s one more subtle but also significant phenomenon — I call it **emergence**.
It’s easier to explain it with sci-fi movies. Here is a plot commonly seen when time-traveling is involved: the main character saved the world (of course!) by doing something they were not likely to do but somehow they did it because they have been through something in the future (e.g. the movie Arrival in 2016).
That kind of story makes sense because the story is logically correct. But it only happens when the future is involved with the present.
So how do these sci-fi movies do with our fate?
It's hard to explain. But if you've ever had an experience where you did something that you would never do normally, but somehow you did it and it changed your life, you might understand what I'm talking about.
These things can never be proven with the scientific method since the other possibility doesn’t show up on the current timeline. But logically it could happen, and subjectively that moment of life feels discontinuous. 
## **Reading The Signs**
Convergence, divergence, and emergence.
They are the three basic forces of fate. The are the road, the signs, and the mountain. We're not to change them, but to follow, and with our best effort, have a great experience out of the driving.
Here are 5 tips I can give you on how to drive on the mountain of your life.
1. **Respect the forces of fate.** We can only go with them but never go against them.
2. **Save your energy when your life is converging.** You won’t make any difference no matter how hard you try to change lanes when there’s no fork.
3. **Be conscious when your life is diverging.** When changes happen, be aware of it and keep the momentum if it’s the direction you want to head in.
4. **Follow the flow of life when life is emerging.** Surrender to the happening in your life, whether it looks good or bad to you right at the moment. Life is most likely to be a much greater plan than what’s in our heads.
5. **Know when to work hard, and when to stay chill.** Above all, enjoy the ride!
