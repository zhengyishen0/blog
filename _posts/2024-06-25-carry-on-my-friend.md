> 3 ideas worth sharing this week.

Hello, my dear friends. 
What’s up? 
What a weird way of greeting. “What’s up”, the short form of “What are you up to?” When I first learned this greeting three years ago, I didn’t know how I should respond. I knew the other person was not really asking about what had happened to me, so most of the time I just said “hello”. But there must be a better way to reply, right? 
This greeting bothered me every time people threw it to me — just like a curve ball you never knew how to catch — until one year later, I finally learned that the “correct” reply should be “not much.”
That doesn't sound any better than my clumsy "Hello," does it?
I never get comfortable with this greeting, even now. But I need to deal with this kind of discomfort every day. 
I guess that is how life is — getting comfortable with the discomforts. There are so many things that don’t make sense to one’s rational mind but it doesn’t matter either. **Life is not about making sense, it’s about carrying on, no matter what.**
This world is getting crazier than ever before. 
We have wars between large civil countries, large language models that are going to make humans obsolete, and two elderly people, one 78-year-old was found guilty of 34 crimes and the other 81-year-old frequently froze in public, campaigning for the next presidency of the United States.
None of them make sense. But we can do nothing but carry on. 
**The gate is where you make money.**
We are all taught to be a valuable person. But value itself doesn’t bring you any fortune in real life. Value without boundary only makes you a doormat. 
To build wealth requires two steps: 
* First, you need a wall. Setting up a wall around the value you created is the only way to claim ownership of it. 
* Next, you need a gate. Anyone who wants to access your value needs to enter the gate and pay a fee.
As simple as that. 
You don’t have to set up the gate only at your own value, you can leverage other people’s value and build walls around them. 
And you don’t have to build your own walls either. Why don’t you build a gate at the ladder against the walls of others? 
**Leadership vs Independence**
Many people think you have to be independent to be a good leader. 
In my practice, I found it’s quite the opposite.
Great leadership requires you to be able to not only be self-reliant, but also take the risk of relying on others. 
Yes, relying on others is risky and takes tremendous courage — because you will encounter disappointments, many many times. 
But being independent can only take you so far. If you want to go further, don’t be a lone wolf, walk with your pack. 
**Downward Compatibility**
This is a technical term in computer science which originally means the newer system should be able to run services from the older systems.
This term has been introduced into social interaction as “having the ability to get along with people who are less competent than you” and it then derived another concept called “upward compatibility” which means being able to connect with people who are more resourceful than you.
Some people believe that these two concepts can be shortcuts to a successful life.
Well…
I’m the type of person who doesn’t want to waste time on people who can’t provide values of a similar order of magnitude to me.
And I don’t expect people who are way more successful than me would ever want to spend too much time on me either.
Because it’s just not fair. 
If the value I can provide is ten times less than the other person, but I expect them to spend lots of time and energy with me, it’s like asking for a hundred dollars at the price of ten. That is a true crime!
But also don’t be limited by your assets either. The value you can provide is different from the value you have. 
To access greater values, we need to discover them first, and that is the real hard work.

That’s all for this week. Cheers!
