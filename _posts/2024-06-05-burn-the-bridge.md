> 3 ideas worth sharing this week.

Hello my friend, how’s your week been going?
This is the latest time I’ve ever written my newsletter in a week. The reason is simple: there are too many things going on after several businesses started growing. Now I kind of regret dropping the course of “Managing Growing Business” at Babson. 
I still remember, in the only class I attended of that course, Prof Edward Marram said “Though inspiring, the growing stage of a business is of tremendous danger.” Now I finally learned it, again, in real life. 
I don’t know if I would get any success in my entrepreneurial journey, but I pretty much enjoy the “learn by doing” experience in my “Post-MBA” year. :)
**How do you want to fail?**
Success is not a high-probability event that happens to anyone. 
One of the greatest lessons I learned at Babson is to embrace failures as part of the plan. 
Yes, I always plan for my failures. 
Every time I think of a new project, I start with the question: _when is the time to quit_? Once I know my failure, I know the risks and the price to pay.
What remains before the quitting line is freedom.
With the many quitting lines I set for my various projects, I also drew the line for the opportunity to be an entrepreneur in this life — the moment when I’m going to stop my hustles and return to the office.
That line is the end of my STEM-OPT.
Even though I got lucky to be selected in the H1B lottery system (less than 25% got selected in 2024), I decided not to proceed with the application. I gave up the opportunity to stay in the US for six more years, in exchange for the freedom and dedication for the next two years.
I’ve burned the bridge behind me, and now let the wind take me to where I belong.
**Just be it.**
I found a pattern from my observation of people.
There’s a kind of people who talk a lot about their identities but do little. And another kind of people who constantly show their progress in various activities.
There I saw the gap between “be” and “being”.
Don’t just wear the hats, do the work.   
The less you claim yourself as someone, the more you are being that ideal self
**“If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together”.**
**—African Proverb**
This was a tough lesson I learned after being a solo entrepreneur for 26 months.
I was a very proud person. I thought I was smart, I could come up with solutions 10x better than most people can do. I thought I was hardworking, I could easily work 60-80 hours a week. So I thought I didn’t need other people. 
I was WRONG. 
It requires so much hard work, suffering, and luck to get to the other side of the river called success. To make the crossing, I need blessings from many many people — from friends and family, from people I know, and even from people I’ve never seen. 
In the end, it is about finding your tribe and setting up the micro-environment surrounding you. 
That’s what every life is doing on earth.
