> The answer is hiding in plain sight.

**What’s the** _**antonym**_**of loneliness?**

- Companionship?
- Connectedness?
- Happiness?
  Close, but not feeling quite right?
  It might surprise you that in the English language, we don’t have a word that is exactly the opposite of loneliness.
  Once we don't have a word for a concept, then it doesn't become part of the personal experience, and it doesn't come up in public discussion.
  That makes the concept of “the opposite of loneliness” even lonelier. — People talk about the topics related to it, topics the opposite of it, but no one can really find a word to talk about it!
  For me, if loneliness has an antonym, then it would best describe the life I want to live. After [three years of searching](https://zhengyishen.substack.com/p/my-not-lonely-journey), I might find a clue…
  **The path to being not lonely is TO LOVE.**
  Yes, I know. “What a boring answer” you might think. But oftentimes the answer to a complex problem is not sophisticated but simple, simple but not easy.
  Love is such a thing.
  Everyone talks about it, everyone wants it, but not many have experienced it.
  Love is too big a topic to cover in one letter, but we can try to unravel its complexity in layers.
  **Love is universal.**
  We have love between intimate partners, love between parents and kids, love between friends, love in passion, love with oneself, love with god...
  Love exists in all kinds of relationships in different forms. It’s not just about kisses and sex. It is the human love we’re talking about.
  **Love is life.**
  We’re born of love and born to love.
  The need to love is not for the exchange of anything but for love itself. For we long to love as much as we long to breathe. When the love stops flowing, it feels like suffocation.
  **Love is permissionless.**
  We need others' permission for friendships, partnerships, and certainly marriage. But no permission is required to love somebody, something, or any form of existence.
  **Love is unconditional.**
  Most relationships are reciprocal. But every reciprocal relationship implies a transaction. — “I love you, but you also need to love me!”
  It takes two Yes to approve, but only one No can make it fall apart. That’s why most relationships are fragile.
  But love is a relationship that expects no return. Your dog loves you, and you know he/she loves you whatsoever. God loves you, and he loves you no matter what.
  **Love is self-sufficient.**
  How can somebody love unconditionally? Because loving is fulfilling.
  When you love, it creates an instant connection between you and the subject and validates the uniqueness of both parties.
  > _“There might be millions of roses in the whole world, but you’re my only one, unique rose.”_ — _The Little Prince_ > **Love is multi-dimensional.**
  > I love you, you love me. But we don’t have to live in the same way.
  > When we accept love to exist in different dimensions, we unlock the possibility of having love relationships in ways beyond our expectations and might even discover that we’re deeply in a “love-net” already.
  > **Love is free.**
  > The world might be full of limitations, but love is always in the realm of freedom.
  > No matter how hard the world isolates you, you can always love — to any subject, at any time, in any way, in any circumstances — and feel connected, enriched, and loved.
  > **Love is the way out of loneliness.** > **Love comes from authenticity.**
  > Authenticity lets you see the real self and the true desires of you and others. Without authenticity, we are left talking in the role of social identities, hugging through the shell of our bodies, and kissing between desire and expectation.
  > No matter how hard we try, the soul is untouched.
  > **Love takes courage.**
  > The path to love and the journey to “not lonely” is full of setbacks and disappointments. It takes great initiative and resilience to walk on this path — a path to the most popular destination, and a path less traveled.
  > **Love is action.**
  > Don’t just talk about love. Start loving.
  > Love this person in front of you, love this task you’re working on, love this moment, love this life, love yourself…
  > Love lies in every little attempt we try that paves the winding path to the opposite of loneliness. Love is a hero’s journey that rescues ourselves and others out of disconnection and isolation.
  > **But love is not easy.**
  > Many times, we try to love. In fact, we love so hard! But the other person just doesn't feel it. In our next letter, we’ll explain the **#1 reason why love doesn't deliver**.
  > Until next time,
