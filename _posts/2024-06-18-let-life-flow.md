> 3 ideas worth sharing this week.

Hello Hello!

I heard excessive heat has been all over the world recently. At least Boston is as hot as an oven. 

And that creates huge troubles for my tennis business. 

Not only did it shrink the available hours for my lessons, but it also added long queues to all the tennis courts and made it merely impossible to teach. But when I was considering stopping the lessons for the heat, I saw silver linings.

When my students first started, they were all quite picky about the courts. So I had to drive 30 minutes to the courts near their places. But because of the hot weather and the frustration of finding and waiting for tennis courts, they have become more comfortable driving a few more minutes to the courts near my place where fewer people play. What a good news!

It’s interesting to see how the heat brought both challenges and opportunities to my little tennis coaching business. And maybe, that is true for everything that happens in life. Maybe, there’s always an opportunity hiding behind a challenge. 

Am I being over-optimistic or it is the true wisdom of life? 

Let me know what you think.

**Don’t be free, charge high.**

A beginner entrepreneur tends to charge people at a low price, and oftentimes even for free — because they are not confident in their products or services. 

That is a huge mistake. 

Because the price is part of the product, sometimes it is the product. 

Consider Louis Vuitton’s bags. Their premium price is one of the reasons people want them — that’s how rich people can differentiate themselves from the masses. A brand like Uniqlo will never deliver you such value.

Charging at a premium price has many more advantages, but I want to pause here and share a bit more about how this principle can also benefit your personal lives and, more specifically, your relationships.

When we care about our loved ones, we all tend to give free services and advice. Though coming from goodwill and love, they might not be appreciated enough or even taken as a burden. That leads to many conflicts and frustrating moments.

But the truth is, none of you is doing wrong. And it certainly doesn’t mean your services or advice is worthless. It’s just a mismatch between what you offer and what the other person needs. 

Sometimes we think giving without getting back is a virtue. It sounds like so, but it doesn’t work out in this way. 

Don’t take the price of your service as being greedy, take it as a metric of how valuable your services are to the other person. If that person does not even appreciate your services, don’t force them to take your goodwill. That would be a sure lose-lose.

**Being useless is being loved.**

In Asian culture, we are all taught to be hardworking, competent, and self-reliant. 

They are all good teachings but might not be appropriate advice for modern life.

The competition for the generations of the 80s, 90s, and now 00s was so heated that it even made the word “involution”, an anthropological concept become widespread. The term “involution” basically means rat race — the faster you run, the faster you have to run. That is what’s happening in China and many Asian countries. 

I was always a good kid, a straight-A student, and a top-performance employee. But the feeling of never enough was draining me down to depression. I was doing great but I never felt happy. Most importantly, I never felt loved. 

What a sad story, both for me and the people who love me.

One day I was sitting on the grass and wondering: the grass looks so happy under the sun, but they don’t have to do anything specific. The birds are joyful as well, and I bet they never worry about being useful to anyone either. Why do I have to be somebody to enjoy my life? Happiness should be part of my human right, isn’t it?

So I started to practice being “less useful”, and even “useless” if I could. Then surprising things happened. 

Not only did I feel less stressed, but people actually perceived me as more valuable. Because once I stopped forcing myself to be someone else, my nature of talents started to blossom. There I learned that [being this unique me is already tremendous value.](https://zhengyishen.substack.com/p/the-value-of-uniqueness)

What’s more. Once I could admit there were things I couldn’t do, I saw other people coming into my life, supporting me, and keeping my life afloat. That’s the moment I felt — **I’m not alone and I’m loved!**

For people who worry about adopting opinions like this would lead to a downward life, no worries. Because that won’t happen. The nature of life is surviving and thriving. If you feel hungry when your stomach is empty, your life is working properly and you are taken care of. 

**Many people think getting into a relationship is like going to a fine-dining restaurant, where you can relax and enjoy yourself. In reality, it's more like a STEM course, with most participants failing multiple times.**

Little thoughts on intimate relationships.

That’s pretty much for this week. See you next time!
