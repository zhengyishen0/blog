> Only one idea for this week.

Dear my friends,
This letter is late, and I was even considering skipping this week. I was about to share some good news with you — I just finished a 5-digit development project in my tech consulting business and my tennis coaching business keeps growing even after I raised my price 50% higher the second time.
But, there’s always a but.
For some reason, my body is not working properly. I feel extreme tiredness and sometimes even hard to breathe. The physical functions of the body are working all right — I can still teach and play tennis, but my overall well-being is underwater. The symptoms sustained till now when I’m writing this letter and I’m still working on it. 
So wherever you are my friend, take care. 
No amount of success can fill the void created by poor health.
Wish you all health, happiness, and harmony.
Yours,
_**Zhengyi**_
