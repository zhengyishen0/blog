> How to navigate your path in uncertainties.

If fate is the path, then luck is the wind.
You can’t drive out of the path, but you can leverage the wind to speed up.
So let’s talk about sailing.
In sailing, the speed comes all from the wind, or to be more specific, the sail that catches the wind. But have you ever wondered, how can sailboats even go upwind if the wind is the only power source?
Once you understand it, you will know how to sail your luck — and accelerate your life even with headwinds.
## Lessons from Sailing
First of all, you need to know the No-Go Zone. It is the 90-degree angle where the wind is coming from. As the name suggests, you’ll get zero speed from the wind and there’s little you can do about it (we’ll also talk about that “little” later).

Understanding the No-Go Zone is extremely valuable. 
**Once we’ve circled out where we can’t go, all the rest left to us is freedom!**
As long as you don’t point dead into your goal and refuse to change, you can always find a path to where you want to be — even in the headwinds.
This is **the art of pivoting**.
Secondly, if you pay attention you may be aware of it — we’re thinking from the perspective of the wind, not ours. 
When we put ourselves in the middle of the map and try to figure out the wind and the speed, it’s confusing. But once we can shift the perspective to the wind, what we need to do is straightforward.
This is **the wisdom of** **perspective shift** (or being less self-centric).
Thirdly, let’s talk about the No-Go Zone again. 
When you’re pivoting, especially when you’re sailing towards the wind, you’ll inevitably cross the No-Go Zone. 
The only way you can cross the No-Go Zone without getting stuck is with your speed. Never lose your speed. 
That’s **the confidence of momentum**. 
Till now we’re only talking about sailing — the wind and the boat. But I believe you’ve understood, that what we’re really talking about is life — the uncertainty of luck and the agility of you as the sailor.
One more bonus tip for you.
In case you hit the No-Go Zone with little speed and get stuck there, which I have been through so many times both in sailing and real life, here’s what you can do — 
Push your sail against the wind and tilt your boat in the other direction.
This is a way to push yourself out of the No-Go Zone — with **the hard work of hustle**.
Or — you can just wait until the wind changes its direction — and it always does.
Or — you can lower your sail half — it’s the universal signal of “I’m stuck. I need help!”
See, **life is full of options, even if you’re stuck.**
Until next time,
