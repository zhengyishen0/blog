> Mastering the art of conflict resolution.

Maintaining a relationship is hard. It’s even harder if you also want to be real to yourself.
There’ll be friction, misunderstanding, and conflicts.
Those are no good feelings. 
People feel anxious about them and even fear for them. So they either go all the way down to compromise all the time, or run to the other extreme and become rigid and aggressive whenever they feel threatened.
So they end up either losing relationships or losing themselves.
If you don’t want to be like that, this is for you.
## **An Anatomy of Conflicts**
I want you to take a close look at an argument you have been through.
How did it begin?
99% of the time it started with tiny little things. But somehow you two just disagreed with each other on that issue and neither of you would let it go. 
What happened next? One of you (sometimes both) got triggered because you thought the other person was not treating you properly. And you turned on your fight or flight model.
Now the house is on fire. Unless one of you is an experienced “firefighter”, the conflict would not stop until it burned something down.
Do you see what’s going on there?
**Disagreement >> Misunderstanding >> Damage.**
That is conflict. It always starts from disagreement, escalates by misunderstanding, and ends up in damage.
## Step 1: Pause
> The best way to stop a fire is to isolate it from oxygen. 
> 
> **The best way to stop a fight is to isolate it from emotion.**
When one of you gets triggered — instead of bursting out or fighting back, do this:
* **Take a pause.** Give yourselves some time to process what’s going on. The less we react subconsciously, the more we can be responsible for. At a minimum, let the emotion cool down before you talk again.
* **Create a physical separation.** Try not to stay in the same space if possible. Take a shower, go for a walk. Once you lose sight of the other person, it gets easier to let go of the opinions that you were so insistent on in the conversation.
## Step 2: Replay
When there’s a conflict, there must be some issues unseen in your relationship. So you need to talk about it and grow from it.
But how?
By addressing the misunderstanding — even if you didn’t see it. 
99% of the time there’s something misunderstood between you. So if you want to do something right, that is the biggest chance you can be “right”. 
In case you need a template to get started. Here’s one.
> _“Hey. I believe you didn’t mean the way I thought it to be, but I feel really <your emotion> after you said/did <what happened>. Can we sit down and talk about it. I don’t want to let any misunderstanding deprecidate our relationship.”_
## Step 3: Stop
> **Always give people a second chance — but never a third one.**
“Wait! What did you mean?”
You give people a second chance to explain because miscommunication and misunderstanding are inevitable in human nature. Since we’re no saints but ordinary people, you’d better let them talk, and you should explain for yourself too.
“But why not a third chance?”
Some people will overdo the explanation-for-understanding part. They will either keep explaining because they think it’s because the other person didn’t understand, or they will keep persuading themselves to understand the other person and risk themselves being treated like a doormat.
The issue is — whether you’re over-explaining or over-compromising — you’re treating the other person like a child. 
You over-explain because you think the other person doesn't understand, which assumes that the other person is not as intelligent as an adult who can figure out what’s going on.
You over-compromise because you think the other person doesn’t mean it, which is based on the assumption that they are just good kids who make mistakes.
Neither is good for the relationship. 
Once you have done the explanation-communication part, stop there.
**Treat them as adults and you will be treated as too.**
Until next time,
