> A reflection on introversion, extroversion, and personality.

My dear friend,
Born as a shy kid, I spent most of my time playing alone and wondering in my imagination. But sometimes, I would be curious about the lives of those popular kids — What would that be like? Could I be that popular kid one day?
As I grew up, I got this feedback from people again and again. “You’re shy, you’re introverted, you’re not good at dealing with people." So and so.
I was a bit upset.
First of all, I was okay as an introvert and I enjoyed my solitude. But why did all of you make introversion sound like a synonym for boring?
Then, the rebellious me wanted to see the other side of the world. The more you said I couldn’t do it, the stronger I wanted to prove it was wrong.
So I started my journey to the “Extroversion” world in a series of trials and errors. After years of exploration, I accidentally made this discovery:
**Introversion is not a Personality, Nor is Extroversion.**
[MBTI](https://www.16personalities.com/) has become a go-to personality test and a common way to introduce oneself in meetups. But there's a common misconception here.
According to the test, Introverted (I) and Extroverted (E) refer to different ways of energy sourcing.

- Introverted people prefer to gain energy from staying alone.
- Extroverted people prefer to gain energy from people around them.
  That's fair enough, but they don't represent your personality. Or to put it another way, whether you're an "I" person or an "E" person doesn't define who you are, they're just your traits. (Same for other letters.)
  "Wait. Why should I even care? I'm happy with being myself!" You may think.
  True.
  So, why don't I tell you a story.
  Say you have a laptop, it has a battery and a charger. When you go to a coffee shop, a popular one as you like the vibe there, it's usually hard to find a spot. So you'll use the laptop on the battery there, as there's not always a socket, and also it's just more elegant.
  But when you need to get some heavy work done, which might be a long essay or video editing, you'll make sure you have the charger plugged in.
  Why is it so? Why can't you just choose to use the battery or charger only?
  "Yes, it's possible. But then my life will be limited..."
  Correct.
  So why do you choose to source energy from one place, for being introverted or extroverted?
  **Introversion and Extroversion are Power Adapters.**
  Everyone has a preference, but you always have access to the other one.
  The problem is people get so married to their choice and even label themselves (and others) by their energy preferences.
  It's commonly heard people say "I'm an introvert, so I don't go to parties." or "I'm an extrovert, I don't stay alone."
  Sounds okay to you, right?
  But what if you hear someone say "I'm a battery guy, I don't use chargers. No. Please don't give me the charger even though I'm low on battery." Or somebody says "I'm a charger guy, I don't use my laptop without a charger. Even I need to get this work done in an hour. No, I won't work on my battery."
  Tell me how do you feel? What would you say to them?
  There's no good or better between these two choices. You'd better have both of them, don't you?
  I understand, there are various reasons why you choose one energy source over the other one. And it's totally fine. It means your primary energy source well-picked. But energy is such an easy-draining resource and it's always good to have an alternative as a backup plan — just like your laptop.
  So the bottom line is:
  Don't just be introverted or extroverted.
  **Be Intra-verted** (aka "be within and without").
  Removing the self-limitation is the first step to unlocking deeper connections with others, and above all, your own beings.
  In this series, we’ll introduce concepts, frameworks, and methods that will help you resume the quality connections you deserve. Some of them might be challenging to your existing beliefs. Skip them when it doesn’t make sense to you. You can always come back later.
  This concludes the prelude of our “Not Lonely” journey. Buckle up!
  Until the next letter,
  _Zhengyi_
