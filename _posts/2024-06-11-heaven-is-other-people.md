> 3 ideas worth sharing this week.

Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, my dear friends.
We live in different time zones on this planet but I want you to know that I am with you. Every week when I’m sitting in a coffee shop and typing down these words, I think of each and every one of you. And I know, that when you read this letter, you have me with you as well. That means a lot to me. You make my world less lonely, and hope I do the same for you.
One thing I learned this week was that it’s blissful happiness if you have somebody you can talk with right away. 
Many of you know my story of going through some [deep isolation](http://Many of you have known my story where I had been through some deep isolation). This week, I had some tough times and I really needed somebody to talk to. I messaged a few friends and they jumped on a call with me immediately, even though the time might not be convenient for them. 
Sartre said, “ _**Hell is other people”. But so is Heaven**_. Thank you all for making my Hell into Heaven.
So let’s get into the three ideas for this week.
**Health is the ultimate Wealth.**
Unless you can feel pleasure just by looking at the big numbers in your bank account, money, in the end, is just a means to the end of pleasure, joy, and happiness.
And that “end” — the receiver of your pleasure, joy, and happiness — is your body. When the body is not in great condition, few things can bring us joy. We all have experienced that during the Covid, don’t we? 
From a biological perspective, all the joy a human can ever experience is produced by the body. Not from a fancy car, not from the 3-star Michelin restaurant, but directly and only from your body. When you have a healthy body, you ARE experiencing the best of the world — a vital life. 
What is the fear of the richest people? — Aging. Cause when you age, your health decreases, and no money can buy back that for you.
I don’t even need to mention the long medical bills after a sickness, do I?
So, don’t sacrifice your health for wealth. It’s never worth it.
**Loneliness is the price of freedom.**
This newsletter is named “Not Lonely”, and I’ve been searching for the answer to not being lonely for over a decade, but the answer is yet to be found.
Instead, the deeper I dig, the more evidence tells me that loneliness is inevitable, and many times a must-have in a growing life.
To be more specific, loneliness is the price of freedom.
If you’re like me, who wants to live a life with agency and autonomy, who is tired of being told what to do and what not, loneliness is what you should expect.
Freedom means you are on a journey chosen by nobody but you. Some parts of the trip may be crowded, but most of the rest is more likely to be a well-traveled trail. 
When I look back, the first year in Boston was the most lonely moment, but also the fastest-growing period in my life. 
Everything has a price, and so is freedom. Once you know that price and you still choose to get it, the pain of loneliness is the proof of progress.
**Shared Interest vs Like-Minded**
Many of my friends asked me about how to find like-minded people. When I asked them to share their experience, the stories looked alike, “you know I like (fill in any interests), so I joined a few groups, but none of them worked out.”
Of course, they didn’t.
Because shared interests are not the same as like-minded. In a way, they are the opposite of each other. Let me explain.
Shared-interest people typically gather together because of what they like. But like-minded people usually find each other because of what they DON’T like.
So you can easily hang out with shared-interest friends on that specific topic, but you’re not likely to build further connections into each other’s personal life.
But like-minded friends are different. You might not know what can bring you the greatest fun, but you know whatever the topic you choose, the experience won’t be too bad — because they all hate what you don’t like.
Shared interest is about the highs, but like-minded is about the lows. In terms of life, how low are the lows are much more important than the height of the highs.
Next time, when you make friends, try to see if you can find any shared dislikes. You’re more likely to build life-long friendships with like-minded people.

Cheers.
