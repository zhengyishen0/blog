> 3 ideas worth sharing this week.

Hello, my friends. How’s your week been going?
Boston finally said goodbye to the long-lasting winter yesterday. Oh boy, I cannot tell you how happy I was when the sunshine warmed my body.
One of the biggest progress I made last week was having several deep conversations with myself and mapping out my desired future — what does the life I want look like this year, next year, in three years, and later? I did it backward, starting from the life I wanted to live three years later and then connecting the dots year by year till I figured out two key focuses for this year — the two most important levers that can lead me to my dream life. I felt all my energy got synergized after doing practice. If you feel like you're not at your best, give this method a try.
Alright, here are the three ideas I’d like to share with you this week.
**To find your niche, you need to want more.**
“Niche down” is a common piece of advice among entrepreneurs. 
Most people think niche down means having less — targeting smaller markets and having few features.
But to achieve that, you actually need to want more. 
If you only want success and wealth. You can achieve them by doing almost anything. But if you want a sense of belonging, respect, reputation, fame, or power, then your needs will filter out options that can not meet all of the requirements.
If you want to earn $100,000 a year, you can find a job, do freelancing, open a restaurant, etc.
If you want to earn $100,000 a year and have a life, you can still find a job but at least not consulting.
If you want to earn $100,000 a year and have a life where you can travel abroad every six months, don’t open a restaurant…  
That’s how you niche down. 
**I think I’m a tree.  
Winds strengthened my truck,  
Rains nurtured my roots,   
And sunshine makes me blossom.**
This is the verse that came to my mind yesterday as I was soaking up the sun.
Just want to share my joy with you.
**The way to have everything is to want nothing.**
I had this epiphany from my own experience and from what I saw in the lives of my friends.
I sponsored my friend in the H1B lottery this April. He wanted it so much as this was the last time for him. I also joined the lottery but was hoping not to get in — I didn’t want to pay so much fee for myself. But the result was quite disappointing. My friend was not selected but I got it.
That is not uncommon. Some people long for a relationship, but they are disappointed over and over again. The subject might vary. Sometimes it’s a job, sometimes it’s an opportunity. What doesn’t change is that it seems like the world has made up its mind not to fulfill our desires. The stronger your desire, the more likely the world is going to let you down. But the moment you “give up hope” and let it be. Suddenly, whatever you have chased for just came to you easily. 
Let me know if it’s also true for you.

That’s all for this week. Take care!
