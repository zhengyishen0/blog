> See your true self and dance at the identity party

The modern world has been hit by a meaninglessness crisis.
People are asking: “What’s the purpose of life? How to find meaning in work?”
If you ask these questions from ancient people, the first humans, even the apes (if they could speak), they would laugh at them as jokes.
_**Life itself is the purpose. Why search for meaning elsewhere?**_
But no. This is a real crisis for us, the modern human.
This all starts with an apple — you know the story.
When Adam first bit the apple, he awakened his awareness of identity, and he felt ashamed of being naked in front of Eve.
Man and woman, that’s the first identity that has been granted.
And that started the division of humans. 
Millions of identities have been created and are being created every moment.
Nationality, party of politics, occupations, school of graduations, even neighborhood! 
At the time of Adam and Eve, there were only two genders. Now, if you live in the US, there are 73 genders! Even Adam needs to eat a few more apples to understand what’s going on!
The divisions that identities create root the cause of endless conflicts and wars, and lead to the choking feeling of meaninglessness in the peace era.
The sense of unity — with other people, with a bigger course, with a higher existence — is what everyone is longing for. But with the many identities we’re wearing and keep adding on, we’re getting further and further away from it.
**Identities are only masks and clothes.**
When we wear our identities for too long and never take off, they grow on our faces and bodies. Finally, we forget about what is the real us and mistake what we wear for who we are. 
The body beneath the clothes is never seen, and the soul within the body is never heard.
There comes the “Identity Crisis” (which has many variations such as the mid-age crisis).
People think the problem is they don’t have enough or proper identities and they keep putting on new ones. No wonder people are spending so much money on clothing, make-up, cars, jewelry, and even higher education (who doesn’t want another beautiful badge).
Unfortunately, that will lead them to nowhere. 
The more money they spend on those identities, the more lost people feel,
The name “Identity Crisis” is fine, but people interpret it in the wrong direction. Having too few or too many identities is not the issue, mistaking them as who we really are is.
I’m not opposing identities. Actually, it’s important to wear the proper identity when you’re dancing in the ball called “Society” (Imagine how much trouble you’ll get if you wear the “I’m the boss” identity while talking with your boss).
Remember, identities are only clothes. 
They are not part of you and it’s better not to let your clothing define you.
But it’s also a bit awkward without wearing one.
And most of the time, it will be very convenient to have one.
So dress as you will and enjoy the party.
Until next time,
