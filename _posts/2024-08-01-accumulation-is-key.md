> 3 ideas worth sharing this week.

Hello, my friends!
Did you miss my letter last week? Actually, I did send out one but only for the paid subscribers. In that letter, I started to write about a new topic: **money and wealth**. 
The more I studied the mechanism of the human world, the more I realized the importance of accumulation — It is the key to everything that matters in life: health, wealth, and relationships.
You can find my last post here: [The Whisper of Wealth](https://zhengyishen.substack.com/p/the-whisper-of-wealth). The only reason I put it behind a paywall is that I realized that investment is the key to returns. Consider that little fee of subscription is your investment in future wealth. I’m not saying that my writing will make you millions of money. But if someone has a mindset of taking things for free, I’d say that that person is not leading himself on the path of prosperity. If you really want to read my articles but for whatever reason (e.g. the card didn’t go through) you cannot make a payment, just leave me a message and I’ll grant you access 100%.
Too much talking about last week’s post. Let’s drop the three ideas for this week.
**Let the fire burn.**
This is the unconventional wisdom I learned from Alex Hormozi’s podcast. 
As a student and an employee, we were taught to make no mistakes and leave no problems unsolved.
But as an entrepreneur, mess is what we deal with day in and day out. There’s always something going on that requires our attention. 
But perfection means no priority. 
As Alex said, there are very few things that will fail a business. 
Learn to sleep while the fire is burning.
**If I waste today**
**I destroy the yesterday of tomorrow**
**and the tomorrow of yesterday.**
This is an interesting idea from the book “The Greatest Salesman in the World”. 
I rephrased the words from the original script because I like the way it reflects the multiple perspectives on “today”.
What we do at present is the Karma for the future and the Hope from the past. 
Future, past, and present are always the same thing and they exist at the same moment.
**Endure** like it’s yesterday.
**Excel** like it’s tomorrow.
And **enjoy** it like it’s now or never.
**Position is Power.**
In tennis, you do not complain about your opponent when they hit a shot out of your reach. You can only control what happens on your side of the court. Hit the ball deep and hard so that your opponent cannot make you feel uncomfortable. 
But once you are in a weaker position, you should expect to be taken advantage of. It’s not because the other person is bad. It’s just human nature.
> _For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away. — Matthew 25:29, RSV._
That works in any relationship. 
Don’t EXPECT the other person to be good, MAKE them in a place where things cannot go wrong. 
Blame is not helping.

That’s pretty much for this week. See you in the next letter.
