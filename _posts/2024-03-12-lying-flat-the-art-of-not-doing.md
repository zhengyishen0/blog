> How to stop internal friction and recover from burnout

> “I don’t need somebody to teach me how to do nothing! I’m good at it. I procrastinate every day! I want to know how to get things done!”
You might have this thought in your mind already. But what if I tell you:
**“Once you know how to do nothing, you can achieve anything.”**
First of all, most people don’t know how to do nothing. 
When you’re procrastinating, you think you’re doing nothing, at least you’re not doing what you think you should do — work, study, or maybe housework. But let’s be frank with ourselves, are you really doing nothing? No! Maybe you’re watching TikTok, scrolling Instagram, or something else. But I’m sure you’re doing something, and it brings tremendous dopamine to you. 
If you have ever tried to do completely nothing — for example sitting still for hours like those Zen monks — you will find it’s 100x harder than doing anything. And that’s why society uses it as a punishment for people who break the laws — free food, free accommodation, and free from doing barely anything — that’s life in prison.
Doing nothing is a way harder requirement for most people (though worth trying). So I’m not saying that you should do nothing, but learn to “not do things”. That is more practical.
## **Procrastination is Good**
You may have a To-Do list, a long list of tasks you assigned to yourself.
But you just don’t want to do it, any of them.
You’re procrastinating.
You feel anxious, depressed, and you hate yourself.
Perfect. We’re going to fix your problem (but may not be how you think it is).
First of all, I want you to understand that procrastination is actually not a problem. **It’s just a sign of misalignment — between what you want to do and what you need to do.**
Think about it. Have you ever procrastinated to have meals when you’re hungry? No. Never. Can you try to procrastinate a little bit when you’re hungry next time? That will be hard, extremely hard especially if you’re really hungry, right? 
So you don’t procrastinate when you’re going to do what you need to do. And in fact, you just can’t.
But you will procrastinate on things you THINK you need to do. And a good example is your To-Do list.
What is a To-Do list? A To-Do list is a junk box of your self-imagination and unrealistic desires.
* Get up and run at 5 am.
* Learn programming after work.
* Finish a task weeks before the due date.
If you think carefully, you’ll realize they are all things you want but not necessarily what you need to do. 
What’s the difference between need and want?
When you need to do something, you don’t get the dopamine rewards until you actually do it. When you want to do things, you get the dopamine rewards right after you think about it.
Getting up and running at 5 am is painful, but imagining yourself doing it is joyful. So your body decides just to think about it and cash out that pleasure.
See, your body never procrastinates — it always does what it needs to do and does it right away.
So next time, when you procrastinate, when you have a strong sense of resistance to the things you plan to do, take a pause. 
Your body is sending you a strong signal: There’s something wrong.
You might have ignored the signal and managed to force yourself to do what it doesn’t want to do many times. The tasks are completed, but the misalignment is still there and keeps wasting your energy and diminishing your vitality. 
If you don’t want to live a depreciated life anymore, do what your self needs, not what the mind wants. Listen to your body.
Until next time,
_**Zhengyi**_
