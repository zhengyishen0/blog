subtitle: 3 things worth sharing this week.

> 3 things worth sharing this week.

As many of you know, I started my entrepreneurial journey last May and have been working on multiple projects all by myself.
Damn, that is such a lonely experience.
Every year, I’ll write down one wish that resonates with me the most and let it set the theme for the next 365 days. This year, the wish reads like this:
**Talk to the world.**
This newsletter is one of the attempts to achieve this goal.
When I say “the world”, it means — you, my beloved friends. You make up my world, and my world expands as more and more of you come into my life. 
Starting from this letter, I’ll share 3 lines that hit me every week. Yes, only 3 things, one about business, one about self, and one about relationships. 
Let’s get started.
**Your business model is the product.**
This line hit me hard in the stomach as I have dedicated my time to building a SaaS business for a year but making zero money from it. 
Why is that? The problem is I was only building software, and expected users to come to it. That might happen for Facebook as there weren’t too many software out there. But it’s not going to happen to my business. 
As an engineer myself, my focus was always on the product development. But without a working business model (having the ability to create, deliver, and capture values), I will never build an MVP (minimum viable product).
**Everything has a due.**
And when the day has come, it's over, and never again.  
Today's sky is so beautiful, but I can't save it for some time later. I have it now, and I only have it at this moment.  
I will say goodbye to this beauty one day.   
I will say goodbye to this lifestyle one day.  
I will say goodbye to this world one day   
It's always now or never.  
And my love is only at this moment.
**Romance is elusive, but love is concrete.**
My friends like to talk about their romantic relationships with me.
So I get the chance to listen and observe.
And I found a pattern.
My friends who have more trouble in their intimate relationships often talk about their “feelings”, or to be more precise, their perceptions of the relationships. 
“We’re soul mates!”
“He doesn’t love me as usual.”
It’s more about how they think of the relationships than what their relationships truly are.
My friends who have much longer relationships behave quite differently. They don’t often talk about their relationships, but they mention their partner (the person) quite often. 
“Oh, Jackie baked the cookies for us.”
“Tom will take me home.”
It may sound very transactional but I can feel the trust and bond between my friends and their partners. 
It’s like their partner is part of their bodies. They trust and rely on their partner as they trust and rely on their hands. 
To me, that is true love.

That’s all for this week. See you in the next letter.
