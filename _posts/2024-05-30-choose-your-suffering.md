> 3 ideas worth sharing this week.

Hello, my friends. 
It has been one year since I took on the entrepreneur's journey. Last week, I finally generated some revenue — not from the apps I built, or the newsletter I wrote, but from being a tennis coach.
Tennis coaching is not a very sexy business compared with tech startups. But it gives me immediate feedback from the real world. I submitted my first post on the RED app (also known as Xianghongshu) and people flooded in. I got thousands of views overnight, hundreds of likes, and tens of clients. 
Damn. That feels so good.
I finally felt the so-called “Market Pull” — when you’re delivering the right value that people desperately need, they will rush to you.
This experience helped me to develop the following framework.
**Viability, Profitability, Scalability.**
From a high-level perspective, these three are all that you need to create a successful business. The challenge is that you cannot always have all three.
I started my business as a SaaS company. The SaaS model is known for its high margin and low cost of expansion. But it suffers from the little chance to hit the viability. That is the well-known concept of “Product Market Fit (PMF)” among tech startup founders and indie hackers.
I also tried e-commerce (and I’m starting a new shop now). The e-commerce model is naturally good at viability and scalability, as people always want more stuff. The challenge for this business model is profitability, in other words, competition. 
The tennis coaching business I just started is a service-based model. It has strong viability and a high-profit margin. The problem is that it’s difficult to scale a business like that. We all have only 24 hours a day, and that sets a cap for the maximum billable hours.
One of my friends concluded it perfectly —
There’s no best way to make money. Making money is essentially hard, it’s all about trade-offs — what kinds of suffering are you willing to take on?
**Passion is the outcome of a good design of life, not the source of it.**
We used to be told that to have a great life, we need to “follow our passion”. 
But every time I tried to follow my passion, it faded away quickly. That made me question myself: 
_Do I really have a passion? Do I lack persistence? Do I deserve a great life?_
But maybe passion is not the answer. A vital life is.
Do whatever can make you feel you want to jump out of bed in the morning, feel peaceful at night, and laugh once a while in the day. 
That kind of life will lead you to your passion. Or maybe you will discover, that everything can be your passion.
**Human is a Naughty Kid**
**Human is the most foolish creature the earth has ever seen.  
Survival is like walking in a heavy rainy night.   
Plants, animals, microorganisms, and many other forms of life are holding up a large plastic cover to protect all of the life from getting wet.  
We humans are just a little kid in the middle who is too short to hold the cover. Because others are busy holding the cover in the rain while we are free to move our hands and even hit others without getting a punch back, we think we are the best, strongest, smartest among all.   
That is not intelligence, that is foolishness, madness.**
A little poem came into my mind one day when I was reflecting on our relationships with the planet and other creatures on Earth.

That’s all for this week, see you next time!
