> A 3-step roadmap of getting your life back on track.

Living in a modern world means constant stress and endless work.
Even the strongest person will feel tired from time to time.
But we’ve been taught to be accountable — “I can’t just drop the project I’m working on. People are counting on me.”
But we’ve been taught to be perfect — “Good is not enough, I’ve got to be the best. There's no excuse to take a break, I need to work even harder.”
Then, sometimes people get burned out.
And that freaks people out.
We’ve been taught how to use ourselves at full speed — see how many people are obsessed with the word productivity. But never has anyone taught us what to do when we run out of fuel.
This letter is going to introduce you to a guide to handle your burnout and get your life back.
It is a 3-step process to turn your burnout into the next growth.

## **Step 1: Stop Bleeding**

Stop everything that is draining you.
If you’re tired of working, take a leave.
If you’re tired of doing housework, let it be messy.
If you’re tired of socializing with people, give yourself solitaire.
The world is rolling forward with or without us.
People around us are less fragile than we think.
Relationships that will break may not be worth continuing anyway.
Nothing will go wrong if we just take a pause.
But if we don’t, our life might.
Taking a full stop is the first step to claim the priority of your own life.
But this is not an easy stop.
You’ll bear lots of social pressure.
People may blame you for being inconsistent, irresponsible, or being out of your mind.
And it’s not easy to say “no” and sometimes you even need to say “I quit”.

## **Step 2: Reorganization**

Stopping bleeding is merely to buy yourself more time and stretch the runway — before you drown yourself into depression and crash your life.
Because it takes time to restructure your life.
Now we’re shifting our focus from immediate energy draining to a long-term perspective — we need to fix the system.
That means drawing your boundaries and cutting off toxic relationships.
It’s challenging and takes a huge amount of courage.
But you gotta do it!
Above is the half of the equation — to preserve as much energy as possible for you so you can reinvest it into what matters to and drives your life.
Identifying which part of life should be cut off and which part of life needs to be doubled down requires a sophisticated diagnosis of every aspect of your life.
The technique I’m using is called “Personal Audit”.
If you’re interested, send me an email and I’ll send you a detailed guide.

## **Step 3: Restart The Engine**

This is the step that helps you from “good to great”.
Since this letter is over-length, we’ll save it for a future letter.
Just a spoiler here. It’s about “Identity Management”.
Until next time,
